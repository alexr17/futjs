# futjs
This is a small repo to practice working with data in Node.js (for educational purposes) and utilize its i/o prowess with frequent http requests.

## Purpose
This repo provides a lightweight framework to download FUT's player database and to also get the price values from futbin. Once the data is downloaded and a working database is set up, there will be a series of functions that can be run to find ideal player formations using graph theory. More libraries may be added in the future.
